## <a name="why-freelancing"></a>Why freelancing?
You may want to get into freelancing for three reasons:

-   To learn

    As a student, freelancing can be a great way to learn. It can provide an insight into how companies work. Working on live projects with actual goals and deadlines gives you a real-world experience that is not easily achieved in the safe, classroom setting.
-   To earn

    Even if you are not short on cash, freelancing can be a way to earn some pocket money. The feeling of independence it provides is worth putting in the hours for.
-   Skill building

    While working, you are simultaneously building your technical skills. This can open doors to bigger and better opportunities in future.

## <a name="a-students-approach"></a>A student's approach
As a student, the right approach is to optimise learning, rather than monetary returns.
For instance, if you are an experienced frontend web developer, the logical move is to venture into backend developement - even if your immediate earning potential is higher in frontend. A similar ideology can be applied in the design side. If you are experienced in UI/UX design, try exploring things like branding or social media.
By working on varying projects, you will gain a diverse, heterogeneous skillset that is more valuable.

## <a name="opportunities-overview"></a>Opportunities Overview
The following are the kind of opportunites currently seen in the market:

-   Web (frontend)

    Every start-up or small business needs a website. And making those websites needs web developers.
-   Android & iOS

    I've never seen a jobless Android developer. The current market demand for Android developers is **too damn high**. As long as Apple is in business, every company will also need an iOS app. Since iOS development requires an iDevice, the supply of iOS developers in the market is less, and are hence valued higher.
-   Backend (web and app)

    To get work as a backend developer, you need frontend and Android dev friends who will recommend you :)
-   Blogging / Content Writing

    I could give you 17 reasons why anyone can be a blogger these days. However, demand for serious bloggers and content writers also exists depending on your domain expertise.
-   Creative Design

    I am using this as an umbrella term for the various creative services required by business. It may include UI/UX design, poster and logo design, video editing, branding etc. In this field, it is difficult to build a reputation. But once you've earned a name for yourself, it can be very lucrative.


## <a name="online-freelancing"></a>Online freelancing
There are several websites that serve as platforms for freelancers to meet clients. For a small percentage of your earnings, these websites will get you clients, and implement some form of an escrow system to ensure that both parties are treated fairly.

-   [Freelancer](https://freelancer.com)

    This happens to be among the popular ones. Here, you need to compete against other freelancers to get your proposal selected. A series of rejections can get disheartening since your work on the bid goes to waste.
-   [Upwork](https://upwork.com)

    This may be a better option for someone looking to make a stable income. You make your profile and list your hourly rate. Start at low rates, rack up good reviews and earn your way to a larger hourly rate.
-   [Toptal](https://toptal.com)

    If you have reason to believe that your skills are better than the majority of professionals in your field. Toptal advertises itself to host the crème de la crème in the freelancing world. You can naturally expect to be paid higher than on other platforms (given you are able to clear the selection process). However, it is only for full-time freelancers.

## <a name="avoiding-common-issues"></a>Avoiding common issues
There can be many issues (pesky clients) you may run into while working as a freelancer. Some of them are:

-   Technically challenged clients
    
    I have worked with clients, who after two months of sitting beside me at work, had no idea what I *really* did (I worked on their Android app as a backend developer). You will often meet who will have difficulty wrapping their head around what you work on. Since they have zero knowledge of technical matters, it can be difficult for them to understand what is easy, difficult, or impossible. Many a times, the freelancer and client run into problems due to not being able to communicate effectively.

-   The future billionaire

    He is convinced his app / website is going to hit it big. His favourite sentence is "We are going to be the Uber of X". Delusional is the word to describe this person. He will not feel stupid dropping the line, "This is a billion dollar idea..." on the first meeting. Unless he has a past record of creating multi-million dollar business, this is the point where you fake an emergency and promise to get back to him next week (never).

-   Sleazy start-up guy

    Hey! I can't pay you right now, but you can be the CTO with X% equity in my startup. This may or may not be the future billionaire's partner in crime. The first question you should ask yourself is, "Why did he just offer me 15% of his self-proclaimed future billion dollar startup on the first meeting?" Dealing with such an insincere person, you will end up wasting a lot of time. Avoid this person at all costs.
