It sometimes happens that a word begins to mean (roughly) the opposite of what it was initially defined to be.

This is the definition of *manufacture* in 2018 -  
**manufacture** | /man·u·fac·ture/ | *verb*  
To make (something) on a large scale using machinery.

However, the word dervies from the latin words *manus* (meaning *hand*) and *factus* (meaning *to make*). The definition of the same word in 1618 was probably -  
**manufacture** | /man·u·fac·ture/ | *verb*  
To make (something) using hands.

As of 2018, the word *self-driving car* means the following -  
**self-driving car** | /self-drɑɪ·vɪŋ-kɑːr/ | *noun*  
A robotic vehicle that is designed to travel between destinations without a human operator.

Perhaps in 2118 it will mean the following -  
**self-driving car** | /self-drɑɪ·vɪŋ-kɑːr/ | *noun*  
A vehicle that is designed to travel between destinations while being controlled by a human operator.

Any other words come to mind? [Let me know](mailto:abhijit@abhijittomar.com).
